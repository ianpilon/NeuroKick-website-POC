## How This Differs from the PowerPoint

### PowerPoint Deck:
- Linear narrative for presentations
- Speaker presents to audience
- Time-bounded (30-45 minutes)
- Controlled environment

### Website:
- Non-linear exploration
- Self-serve information discovery
- Unlimited time to explore
- Uncontrolled environment (user driven)

### Key Differences in Approach:

**1. Navigation:**
- PowerPoint: Presenter controls flow
- Website: User chooses their journey (stakeholder pages, skip around)

**2. Depth:**
- PowerPoint: Surface level with speaker adding detail
- Website: Multiple layers (homepage → stakeholder page → case study)

**3. Privacy Messaging:**
- PowerPoint: Slide 7, addressed in context of full story
- Website: Manager page leads with it (above fold, first thing seen)

**4. CTAs:**
- PowerPoint: Single CTA at end (demo/pilot)
- Website: Multiple CTAs throughout (demo, pricing, learn more, email)

**5. Proof:**
- PowerPoint: One case study slide
- Website: Testimonials throughout, stats in hero, full case study section
